# üìñ Japanese Kanji Reader

An AI-powered mobile PDF reader designed for Japanese language learners to
master kanji and vocabulary while reading their favorite books and manga.
This application provides real-time kanji analysis without interrupting the reading experience.
As of now, the kanji analysis only works with images.

# User Flow
- Open a new PDF page
- touch the "learn" button on the top right of the reading screen
- Quickly visualize:
    * Context of what is being said on the page (AI-generated)
    * All Kanji present on page (e.g: ['Êº¢', 'Â≠ó'])
    * All the words that are being formed by the kanji on the page (e.g: Êº¢Â≠ó)
- Update the view counter on a kanji everytime you see them in your reading journey
- Check the "knowledge bank" to see how many times you've seen each kanji, along with kanji
you've never seen before. Works just like a Pokedex!

Like reading with the help of a dictionary, but much more practical!

## üéØ Project Vision

**Core Principle**: Non-intrusive learning that never interrupts reading flow

**Key Innovation**: Universal kanji knowledge bank that grows across all reading materials - kanji learned in manga helps with novels, news articles, and any other Japanese content.

#### **üì± Core Reading Experience**
- **PDF Import & Reading**: Full PDF viewer with page navigation and progress tracking
- **Image Analysis**: Complete OCR pipeline for Japanese text extraction form PDF pages
- **File Management**: Local storage system for imported PDFs
- **Reading Progress**: Automatic bookmark saving and quick resume functionality

#### **üß† Knowledge System Foundation**
- **Kanji Database**: SQLite integration with KANJIDIC2, JMdict, KRADFILE, and RTK stories
- **Universal Knowledge Bank**: Cross-content kanji tracking system
- **Japanese Text Processing**: OCR with Google Cloud Vision API for image analysis
- **Gamefied learning**: Unlock new kanji as you read more books

#### **üé® User Interface**
- **Bottom Sheet Learning**: Non-intrusive kanji analysis interface
- **Progress Visualization**: Reading statistics and knowledge bank metrics

#### **üíæ Data Architecture**
- **Local-First Storage**: Complete offline capability for processed content
- **Smart Caching**: OCR results and text analysis cached permanently
- **Reference Databases**: ~70MB of bundled Japanese language data

### ‚è≥ **In Development**

#### **Text Processing Pipeline**
- **PDF Import & Reading**: Full PDF viewer with page navigation and progress tracking
- **PDF Text Extraction**: Connecting PDF viewer to Japanese text analysis
- **Real-time Kanji Identification**: Live analysis during PDF reading
- **Knowledge Bank Integration**: Automatic "times seen" counter updates
- **Learning Progress Tracking**: New vs. previously encountered kanji detection

### üìã **Planned Features (Future Phases)**

#### **Phase 2: Enhanced Learning**
- Advanced kanji organization (grouping, search, sorting)
- Detailed radical breakdown and stroke order
- Smart offline preprocessing for entire books
- Performance optimization for large documents

#### **Phase 3: Cloud & Social**
- Cross-device sync and backup
- Vocabulary and context sections
- Gamified learning strategies

## üèó Technical Architecture

### **Technology Stack**
- **Frontend**: React Native with TypeScript
- **PDF Processing**: react-native-pdf (with planned MuPDF migration)
- **OCR**: Google Cloud Vision API (Japanese optimized)
- **Text Analysis**: SudachiPy (planned for morphological analysis)
- **Local Storage**: AsyncStorage + SQLite + File System
- **Navigation**: React Navigation v6

- Kanji categorization (New vs. Previously Seen)
- "Knowledge bank" section for reviewing kanji
- Search and sorting capabilities
- Expandable details sourcing stories from the book "Remembering the Kanji"
for effective memorization

## üìä Current Limitations

### **Technical Constraints**
- **New Content Processing**: Requires internet for OCR of unprocessed pages

### **Feature Gaps**
- **PDF reader**: Not yet implemented
- **Kanji listing**: Kanji are properly iodentified in images, but not listed in the bottom sheet
- **PDF Kanji Analysis**: Not yet connected to reading workflow
- **Vocabulary Section**: Planned for future development
- **Cloud Sync**: Local-only in current version
- **Advanced Analytics**: Basic progress tracking only
